    <div id=statement>This is a digital mimicry of my apartment, an exploitation of the alienation of being alone in a space that is only temporarily mine. This space I occupy does not exist to any of you beyond being a Zoom background, 2D until proven otherwise, but it has also begun to stop existing for me, a sort of constant feeling that this isn’t real either. A lot of my work this past year has been about the process of translation from physical to digital, or vice versa, so this is a continuation of the emotion we can experience through that process.<br> I chose a digital platform because it can be widely shared, and because we should question the dichotomy of physical and digital experiences, as Legacy Russel says, “That which is "virtual" is assumed to not be real, yet it needs to be asserted that what happens in these vast digital landscapes is, in fact, very real, and non-negotiably so.” I want to both explore the difference between you visiting the fake domestic rather than the real with its lingering unease and explore my existence in both as the viewer and unbodied host. The virtual backdrop is thematically in line with the concept of distorted isolation, a real and isolated experience for you the viewer, and also quiet utilitarian when we all cannot exist in the same physical space together.<br>So I had my platform and a theme, but I did not know how to proceed aesthetically until I was laying in bed, when I remembered playing with cut out dolls from magazines. Collages, paper dolls, very domestic and nostalgic, and very 2D, allowing for contrast with a VR space. I also was struck by Laurie Anderson, who to paraphrase an interview about her piece “chalkroom”, said VR is very hard, and for it to be interesting it must be soft. Creating painterly monotypes allow for objects being handmade, even as they exist in the digital realm.<br>This is my living room, where you would first enter from the front door, but it isn’t really. It’s the impression of my living room, we can look around and pass through but not interact. There are some rubbings lifted from the real space, but most exist as representational mockups. I was looking at some of the architect Mies van der Rohe’s drawings when working on the perspective, taking cues from the high contrast objects that float and minimal floor and ceiling planes. The cutouts were printed and are all arranged to give the appearance of forced perspective, and as you move the illusion is broken. They are recognizable icons of a home, but distorted through the changing view; comfortable and physical and known but in a new and strange and sharp environment.</div>
